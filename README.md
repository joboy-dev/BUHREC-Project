### OPTIONAL
You can create a virtual environment before running the commands in number 2.

#### Creating the Virtual Environment
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment.
- Execute the following command:
    `python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`
- Replace /path/to/new/virtual/environment with the desired location for your virtual environment. For example:
    `python -m venv .venv`
- This will create a virtual environment in the current directory.
- On Windows, you can also use the following command:
    `python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv`

#### Activate the Virtual Environment
After creating the virtual environment, activate it:
- On Windows:
    `.venv\Scripts\activate`

- On macOS/Linux:
    `source .venv/bin/activate`

#### Deactivate the Virtual Environment
When youâ€™re done working in the virtual environment, deactivate it:
    `deactivate`
